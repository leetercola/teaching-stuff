Learning resources for a friend trying to learn web development.

The point of your portfolio is to work through building components or things that interest you but show your ability to work with common technology and design elements needed to impress a potential employer. 

The goal isn't to do it all yourself use starter packs or bootstrap libraries and elements to get you going. The important part is to be able to speak to why you chose the package you did, what / how you used it and how you would go about doing development without the pack. Employers will want to know that you have experience with whatever their choice of libraries / languages / tooling, and that you have to skills to critically evaluate them. Knowing whats good, bad, and how to get out. Almost everything in your job will start with something else as a base but every company has needs for customization.
Your goal is to be knowledgable enough to start fast and contribute, so you can deliver features on time, with enough knowledge to keep you from committing bad code that will need to be replaced almost as soon as you write it.

## Portfolio stuff
1. Component library. Gives you a good starting point for new gigs and works through standard components you'll need to build anyways.
    ### Examples
    1.1 https://material-ui.com/demos/app-bar/
    1.2 https://reactstrap.github.io/components/alerts/
2. Look at potential places of employment inspect their websites and source code, put together features that you think are lacking or features you think you might end up helping with.
    2.1 store locator ( fake the data it doesn't matter but show that you can read other people's api's and use them )
    2.2 message or notification center
3. Look at your own work, life, hobbies. Is there anything you would find useful if you built it yourself.
    3.1 shared calendar or task board for you and the wife thats sync'd between different devices (Phone, server, her phone, tablet).
    3.2 Game or card stuff, dice roller, DnD companion stuff.
4. Never Underestimate the power of a good blog. Doesn't have to be fancy or lengthy but blog posts about what you are learning as you go
or new technology you've looked up. 
    4.1 Really this shows how your mind works through problems.
    4.2 How you might teach and become a mentor to other developers.
    4.3 Your ability to document and share the resources and tools you create for those that will come after you.
